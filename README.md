I try to Solve Some Quetion Related to Filter, Map, Reduce, and Sort Methods of Array.

**Practice 1**

**Filter Questions**
1: Find all sales from the "East" region.<br>
2: Get all orders where the item sold was a "Tablet".<br>
3: List all sales made by the salesperson "Emily".<br>
4: Retrieve orders where the total sale amount (Sale_amt) exceeded $15,000.<br>
5: Find all sales that occurred in the year 2019.<br>
6: List the orders made in the first quarter (January - March) of any year.<br>
7: Get sales that happened on or after October 1st, 2020.<br>
8: Show sales where the number of units sold was between 30 and 50 (inclusive).<br>
9: Find orders where the unit price was less than $200.<br>
10: Identify sales where the total sale amount was between $5000 and $8000.<br>
11: Find all "Laptop" sales made in the "West" region in 2020.<br>
12: Get sales made by "Timothy" where the item was a "Smartwatch" and the sale amount was over $10,000.<br>
13: List all sales in the "Central" region with a unit price below $100 that occurred before 2021.<br>
**Filter Questions**
1: Calculate an array where each element represents the total Sale_amt for each order in salesData.<br>
2: Create a new array containing only the distinct regions present in salesData.<br>
3: Generate an array where each item's name is capitalized (e.g., 'Laptop' becomes 'LAPTOP').<br>
4: Create an array containing the Sale_amt of all orders where the Unit_price was above 300.<br>
5: Create an array with the names of Salespeople who have sold 'Smartwatch' items.<br>
6: Create a new array where each element is the Sale_amt multiplied by 1.1 (representing a 10% increase).<br>
7: Calculate an array containing the profit for each sale, assuming a 30% cost on each item. (Profit = Sale_amt - (Unit_price * Units * 0.3)).<br>
8: Explain the difference between using .map() and .forEach() to loop through an array like salesData. Choose a scenario where one might be better than the other.<br>
9: What does it mean that .map() is a non-mutating method? How does this differ from methods like .sort()?<br>
